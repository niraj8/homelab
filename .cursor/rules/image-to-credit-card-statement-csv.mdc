given a screenshot of transactions, return a csv file with 3 headers: date, desc, amount

`date` format: dd-mm-yyyy
`desc` should either be the merchant name, prefer smallcase
`amount` dont write commas as this may break the csv file. use minus sign for debit, + sign for credits

- write this file in data/credit-card-statements/<card-last-4-digits>-<month>-<year>.csv
- card last 4 digit will be visible in the screenshot, so will month
- in case year isn't seen in the image, default to 2025
